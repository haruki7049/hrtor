# hrtor's background
Originally, there was only one editor, the 'GNU ed editor'. As time went by, many editors were born, including vim, neovim, emacs, and other popular editors in existence today. Finally, GUI-based editors such as VSCode and JetBrains were born. However, line editors are no longer in use today. I thought, "Why not develop an extensible line editor? Wouldn't it be interesting to develop an extensible line editor?"

I made it!
